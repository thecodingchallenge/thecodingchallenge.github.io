# 100 Days Coding: Approach and Why Behind it


#### Why 100 Days Coding Challenge

- I've not done coding in a while. This is a wonderful way to spend quality time pursuing coding. 
- 100 days is long enough to get a deeper immersion in coding. 
- 100 days coding is a very structured challenge. There is even a [website](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) dedicated to how to approach this.
- I've recently learnt the power of [SRS (Spaced Repetition System)](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html). I believe it is a revolutionary method to learn AND retain anything for the long term. I'm committed to this approach. More I practice this approach, better I will get in using this. I'm already learning French with SRS. I'm keen to give spin to use SRS system to learn Python too. 



#### Why take this Challenge in Python

- I want to get better in Python. 
- Python can be gateway to learn AI/ML next, which is becoming an interest .
- It will connect me more on the technical aspects, which I was missing



#### Tools and selection

###### Code Editor: Visual Studio Code

- Though I am always biased towards Vim due to my experience in it, this time I will use Visual Studio code. Mainly two reasons:

  - I want to experience the benefits of a modern editor and make an informed choice on it, rather than just being stuck in past that "vim is the best" (even though it is)

  - My daughter is also picking up Python. GUI based editors make her focus on learning language first, rather than learning tool. So, if I know VS Code better, I can help her in this.

###### Code Repository: GitHub

- Obvious choice, Git is industry standard for Source Code Management and my code out in the public will keep me accountable.
- It will also improve my skills on Git.

###### Anki Flashcards for learning
- Big "why" behind this challenge is to get better at learning. 
- Will follow Derek sivers [advice](https://sive.rs/srs) on how to create Anki Programming Cards. 

###### Progress Tracking: Blogging Platform: Jekyll on Github
- I want to blog the progress. I am very comfortable with Jekyll/Github setup, will take 15" to set up a new blog, dedicated only to this challenge. 
- Writing in markdown will let me focus on writing quickly. The approach is "Learn. Write. Publish". 

###### Progress Tracking: Twitter 

- Just daily post of progress with Hashtags : #100DaysOfCode #100DaysOfCode #pythonlearning #100DaysOfPython
